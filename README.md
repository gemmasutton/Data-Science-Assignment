# Data-Science-Assignment-

This program is written in Python for elementary analysis of Flourescent cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) data. The program can be used for analysis of any FCCS data of any two molecules with dual-coloured fluorophores measured from either in vitro or in vivo systems. The program enables the user to calculate the dissociation coefficient, KD, of two molecules, and summarises the the concentrations and rates of diffusion of ligand, receptor and the ligand-receptor complex (known as cross). 

To run:

1. Download python scipts and example data files (FCCS_run1.csv, FCCS_run2.csv and FCCS_run3.csv) into a single directory.

2. Run the script and check the dataframe format. The RUN column indicating each observation number during the experiment should be the first column in the dataframe that is suitable as an index column. 

3. The data is used to calculate the KD and then summary
