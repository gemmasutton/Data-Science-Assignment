# Data-Science-Assignment-

This program is written in Python for elementary analysis of Flourescent cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) data. The program can be used for analysis of any FCCS data of any two molecules with dual-coloured fluorophores measured from either in vitro or in vivo systems. The program enables the user to calculate the dissociation coefficient, KD, of two molecules, and summarises the the concentrations and rates of diffusion of ligand, receptor and the ligand-receptor complex (known as cross).
